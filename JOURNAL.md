## 10/23/2025 - THE LAST AND FIRST UPDATE !  

Hey Fellas ! 
This was my first time working upon a Blueprint Project so i didn't knew that i need to upload a journal after each work i do on this project as i thought that i would need to just ship a project with the total number of hours and the repo link ... I admit this mistake and hereafter won't repeat this in my next project .

HOWEVER THE MAIN JOURLAING CAN BE FOUND IN MY GITHUB REPO .. ![Screenshot 2025-10-23 013758.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUzMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--baced6280a0c51d1d6b62004079f8a9570ba148d/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20013758.png)

## 11/8/2025 11:14 PM - Started The PCB Work   

## 23rd October , 2025

This was the first day i started actual working on this project , as per my plan , i started with the PCB work , the very first thing was to do was making and deciding the dimensions of the PCB. I took it as a normal hackkpad size and further added all the components one by one and made a clear wiring , it was not tough for me , i already had some experience so it doesn't took so long ![Screenshot 2025-10-22 231755](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTUxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f421845dc6d095230d763d75abe8425e6594b5c7/Screenshot%202025-10-22%20231755.png)

The Very dame day , i thought to finish the PCB part completely so i also moved ahead and got my hands om the routing work , i took a little help of my brother to do so and then it was not as much difficult as i expected , this was fun doing , i am i quite beginner in the routing work so i was stuck while routing on fron and back sides simultaneously , i needed some tutorials and after that it was easy . Now i was having my OCB part complete at all , scheatic and routing both were complete . ![Screenshot 2025-10-22 231843](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTUxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--415408e8245a3d203435bff90670e8b5c5362680/Screenshot%202025-10-22%20231843.png)

## 11/8/2025 11:25 PM - The CAD WORK   

## 24TH OCTOBER , 2025

I thought that this will the final day of my project as i will code and do the CAD work on the same day , so first as i've already made the PCB , i thought to go with the CAD work 

I am a total new guy if its CAD , i literally wasn't knowing anything , i just went on yt and searched for some CAD tutorials , hopefully with the help of a frnd , i was able to complete this . 

I started with the BASE part first , the sketch part wasn't easy at all , i was stuck when i had to create holes for mounting and also during fillets . This was the most difficult part for me , both in base and in top . Still i did it with dedication and was able to complete within 5 hours. [UHMM , A BEGINNER TAKES TIME, DONT JUDGE ] .

I was soo tired after the CAD work but a cup of coffee made me awake till 3 am , i was able to finish the code easily as i was having pre-experiences in coding already , no took any help from tutorials and did it solo .
